	    <td width="32%" valign="top">RLE&nbsp; Technologies manufactures three different&nbsp; 
	    types of leak detection systems:spot detectors,zone leak detection systems, 
	    and distance-read leak detection systems. Each system offers its own unique 
	    benefits.<br>
	    <br><br>
	    <b>Spot Detector</b><br>
	    A spot detector senses&nbsp; water at a single point. They are most 
	    frequently used in small rooms, air conditioning drip pans or dams, and 
	    around floor drains. Spot detectors are the most economical way to detect 
	    water.<br>
	    <br><br>
	    Each spot detector must connect to a control module. This control module is 
	    usually mounted on a wall in a high traffic area and provides visible and 
	    audible annunciation of a water leak. A typical spot detector application 
	    includes one or multiple spot detectors connected to RLE's RASP unit.<br>
	    <br><br>
	    <b>Cable System</b><br>
	    Cable systems are suggested for large areas. They provide better floor 
	    coverage than spot  detectors. Cable Systems can be configured as zone 
	    systems or distance-read systems.<br>
	    <br><br>
	    <b>Zone System</b><br>
	    When a zone systems is installed, sensing cable is placed on the floor or 
	    sub-floor around leak sources.<br>
	    The space is divided into multiple area, or zones. Each cable monitors one 
	    zones. If water or other conductive liquids contact the cable anywhere along 
	    it slength, the control panel annunciates the leak and in which zone the 
	    leak is located. Control panels are available to support one(LDZ1), 
	    four(LDZ4), or eight zone's(LDZ8).<br><br></td>

	    <td width="32%" valign="top">
	    <p align="left">Each individual zone's sensitivity is adjustable.<br>
	    <br>
	    <br>
	    <b>Distance-Read System</b><br>
	    Distance-read systems pinpoint the location of a water leak. Distance-read 
	    systems are particularly useful in facilities with large raised-floor area.<br>
	    <br>
	    <br>
	    <br>
	    This technology features up to 5000 feet of leak detection cable. The cable 
	    is placed on the floor or sub-floor around possible leak sources. When a 
	    leak occurs, the control head annunciates this information and provides a 
	    distance measurement. This distance measurement is cross-referenced with the 
	    cable route map and the location of the leak is calculated within a few 
	    feet.<br>
	    <br>
	    <br>
	    An LD5000 control head is used with the distance-read system. Sensitivity is 
	    adjustable.<br>
