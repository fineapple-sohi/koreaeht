        from blank circuit board fabrication through final assembly, extensive 
        burn-in and test.<br>
        Chromalox leaves nothing to chance. We control our quality, firsthand.<br>
        <br>
        The result is the ultimate degree of control. Chromalox instruments meet 
        the most demanding requirements around: military specs... NASA 
        standards... and the demands of world-scale engineering and construction 
        firms... OEMs...and specifications in virtually any process or plant 
        that depends on electric heat, from the North Slope of Alaska to Saudi 
        Arabia... to wherever your process has to go to work. Apply your 
        technology wherever you need control. For applications assistance,
