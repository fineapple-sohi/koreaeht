		    Freezing, Dew point<br>
		    Component drop-out,<br>
		    Viscosity, Personnel<br>
		    protection</b></i><br>
		    Freezing, dew point, component drop-out and viscosity control are major 
		    considerations in instrument and small diameter process lines. A property 
		    designed and selected pretraced tubing bundle offers an effective solution 
		    to these problems.<br>
		    <br>
		    <i><b>The economical choice to field fabrication</b></i><br>
		    Maintenance free <font color="#000080"><b>TRACEPAK</b></font> not only saves 
		    money and time during the installation process, but it ensures consistent, 
		    repeatable performance. Field fabrication requires a pipe fitter to lay out, 
		    measure, cut , dress, bend and install the tubing. Next the tracer (steam or 
		    electric) has to be installed and insulation put on the tubing. Finally, a 
		    weatherproof&nbsp; covering needs to be applied over the insulation. Clearly 
		    the economics of the <font color="#000080"><b>TRACEPAK</b></font> system 
		    versus field fabrication are significant.</td>

		    O'Brien Corporation, long recognized as the leader in providing reliable 
		    instrumentation protection, has simplified installation while offering 
		    predictable operation.<br>
		    <font color="#000080"><b>TRACEPAK </b></font>tube bundles are prefabricated, 
		    pre-engineered and preinsulated assemblies.<br>
		    <br>
		    Installation is simplified by the unique parallel configuration, in which 
		    process and tracer lines are always parallel inside the bundle. The bundle 
		    is much easier to bend during field routing and hookup because all tubes 
		    bend together and not against one another.<br>
		    <br>
		    <i><b>Connections are easy because tubing stays round and is not work 
		    hardened</b></i><br>
		    <font color="#000080"><b>TRACEPAK'</b></font>s configuration allows the 
		    tubing to stay round and malleable when used in conjunction with compression and flare fittings. The 
		    installation of process and instrument connections requires only a simple, 
		    one-plane offset bend to engage tubing and fittings</td>

		    O'Brien Corporation utilizes the highest quality materials. The tough 
		    elastomeric jacket contains no halogens, eliminating the possibility of 
		    chlorides from the jacket causing stress corrosion in stainless steel 
		    tubing. This jacket has excellent abrasion and chemical resistance along 
		    with a wide, usable temperature range.<br>
		    <font color="#000080"><b>TRACEPAK</b></font> can be installed in 
		    temperatures as low as -40℉.<br>

		    <i><b>3 Types of tubing bundles<br>
		    There are three common types of pretraced lines:</b></i><br>
		    <br>
		    ▼ Single preinsulated line TPS,<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp; primarily for steam supply and<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp; condensate return.<br>
		    <br>
		    ▼ Steam traced lines, TPL &amp; TPH,<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp; for freeze protection and<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp; temperature maintenace.<br>
		    <br>
		    ▼ Electric traced lines, TPE, for<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp; freeze protection and <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp; maintenance of temperature.</font></td>
