	     The Chromalox line of SCR power controllers covers the full range of 
	         power and heat control applications - simply, economically, and 
	         reliably, A large number of manufactures use Chromalox power components 
	         as original equipment controllers work without mechanical, moving parts 
	         and are capable of millions of reliable operations. And because the 
	         SCR's fast ON/OFF cycling maintains process temperature much closer to 
	         set point, heater life is extended by elimination of thermal shock. 
	         Whatever the application, you can depend on Chromalox for the ultimate 
	         degree of power control.<br>

	         <b>Model 4115 Solid State Power Controller</b><br>
	         Featuring dual SCR design, the Model 4115 accepts any DC control input 
	         signal from 3 to 32V DC, for ON/OFF switching of 40 ro 90A, 120 to 480V 
	         AC loads.<br>
	         <br>
	         <b>Series 4117 AC Power Controller</b><br>
	         Engineered for fast, easy installation and long-term dependability, the 
	         4117 is a complete zero cross-over- fired, 3-phase, 2-leg power 
	         controller. The 4117 will accept either 4-20mA control signal input or 
	         8 to 48V DC voltage input. Multiple units can be powered by the same 
	         control signal.&nbsp; Loads up to 20kW for 240V AC and 59 kW for 480V 
	         AC can be switched by the 4117.<br>
	         <br>
	         <b>Series 4120 SCR Power Controller</b><br>
	         A totally new concept in packaging for SCR power instrumentation that 
	         results in space savings and more efficient heat dissipation! The zero 
	         crossover-fired,3 phase, 2-leg design and easy application of l<span lang="en"><font face="굴림">²</font></span>T 
	         fusing and power termination, combined with unique packaging, offer 
	         OEM's the most advanced power control system available. The 240V AC 
	         units are rated up to 89kW and 480V AC units are rated up to 170kW.<br>
