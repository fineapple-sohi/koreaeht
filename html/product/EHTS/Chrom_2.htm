	    <br>
	    Screw plug immersion heaters consist of hairpin bent tubular elements brazed 
	    or welded into a screw plug and provided with wiring boxes for electrical 
	    connections. Screw plug immersion heaters are screwed directly through a 
	    threaded opening in a tank wall or through a matching pipe coupling, half 
	    coupling or welding flange. Sizes of screw plug heaters are available with 
	    1/2&quot; , 3/4&quot;, 1&quot;, 1 1/4&quot;. 2&quot;, and 2 1/2&quot;&nbsp; pipe threads. A wide selection

	    Over-the-side immersion heaters are designed for installing in the top of a 
	    tank with the heated portion directly immersed along the side or at the 
	    bottom. This provides easy removal of the heater and ample working space 
	    inside the tank. These heaters are available with heating elements made of 
	    copper, steel, stainless steel, lead, cast iron, incoloy, titanium, teflon 
	    coated and quartz. A wide selection of kilowatt ratings, shapes and mounting 
	    methods are available to suit many different types of applications. </td>
