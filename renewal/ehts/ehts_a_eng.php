In order to resolve these kinds of difficulties, Heat Tracing methods such as Steam, Hot Water, Heating Medium have developed for many years, and They have been used on the site usefully. However, there are still difficulties in construction and maintenance in these methods. So, Electric  Heat Tracing  was developed as a new Heat Tracing  method.

In addition, Electric Heating Cable is good at flexibility and has large surfaces, which is useful to maintain suitable temperature by increasing heat efficiency.
Above all, it is generally used in Europe and U.S, compared with other methods. This one is easier to do maintenance and construction. Electric Heat Tracing cable includes Self-Regulating Heating Cable, PTFE Heating Cable, Mineral Insulated Heating Cable, and SECT System.

		    The heating matrix of SR Cable is consists of Polymer+Carbon which is a semiconductor.
It forms numerous parallel electric circuits between 2 bus wires. A self regulating cable adjusts its output to independently respond to temperatures all along its length.  As temperature increase, the heater¡¯s resistance increases which lowers the output Wattage. Conversely, as the temperature decreases, and the resistance decreases and the cable produces more heat. So, we called it self-limiting Heating cable which is an energy efficient heating cable.

		    Series Resistance heating Cable forms a series circuit by one heating element with Teflon sheath. It effects in various output from freeze protection to high temperature maintenance by various resistance values based on length. Series Resistance Heating Cable has heat-resistance property which enables it to stand the high temperature of 250¡É and it is used in various voltage range from 0 to 500 Volt.
This cable is suitable for explosion area and also has the property of chemical resistance which enables it to stand strong acid and alkali. One of the merits of Series Heating Cable is Flexible type, which is easier to install than others.

This cable¡¯s resistance value is changed according to the length. So, output can be controlled by cutting the cable properly. It is used Snow melting as well as Chemical plant & Floor warming because this cable is superior in the durability and thermal resistance and It is encased in a metallic jacket.</td>
