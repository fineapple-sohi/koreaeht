          conditions of severe northern winters. Thousands of systems have been delivered to U.S. and Canadian
          railroads since 1978.<br />
          This railroad switch heating system utilizes materials and techniques developed by Thermal-Flex, Inc. for
          relieving internal stresses created in massive steel parts (ex. pipes, valves, etc.) by the heat of welding. The
          elements of the system are tough and long lasting, since they were originally designed to withstand the wear
          and tear of repeated use in the rugged conditions of the construction sites.</td>
