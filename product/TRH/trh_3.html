              of a nichrome wire wrapped around, parallel<br />
              insulated buss wires. At specific intervals, a<br />
              short section of insulation is removed from<br />
              alternating buss wires to create connection nodes 
              for the nichrome wire. <br />
              The nichrome wire is
              soldered to the buss conductors, creating a
              network of parallel resistors along the entire
              length of constant wattage cable. They can be
              designed to operate at specified voltages between
              120- 800 Volts AC/DC. Constant watt cables are</td>

          heat. A self-regulating cable adjusts its output to respond to temperatures all along its length.

          The coiled alloy heating element has a power-limiting feature, where the element responds to an increase in

          resistance, referred to as PTC (Positive Temperature Coefficient), reduces the path for electrical current
          thereby reducing the power output of the cable. The PTC feature allows the cable to maintain lower sheath
          temperatures, which prevents the heating element from overheating.</td>

          electrical and thermal properties and is well suited for most chemically hostile environments.</td>
